Concert Venue API with Spring

Project Description
This project created a simple web API that would connect to a SOAP service and a RESTful service. This was done in order to create a RESTful user facing service that would sell concert tickets to a prospective customer. The initial idea for this was for a customer to call in to the service and place an order by their individual ID numbers.
